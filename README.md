- Hello, Iâ€™m @BangTheBanger.
- There isn't much to say, and I honestly don't know how or why you ended up in this page. Since you're here though, I might as well say something.
- I'm just a poor man from a poor family wondering who will shield my eyes from this monstrosity.
- I work on a few languages, I'm not exceptional. I am a good googler though.
- Eh... I also like music. Electronic, Rock, Pop, a mix of all of it...
- I play lots of games too. Since I won't update this a lot I don't think I should date myself 20 years from now when a game I play isn't relevant anymore, so I won't list any of them, but I do play a lot of games.
- Anyway, have a good one.
